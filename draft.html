      <h2>Draft Pick Notes</h2>
      <div class="notes-block">
        <h3>2026:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>If the 76ers’ pick lands between 1 and 4, Philadelphia keeps the pick.</li>
          <li>If the pick lands 5 through 30, it goes to the Oklahoma City Thunder.</li>
          <li>Example: If the Sixers finish with the 2nd-worst record and win the lottery, they keep the pick. If they finish with the 7th-best record and land pick #22, OKC gets the pick.</li>
          <li>If the pick is not conveyed in 2026, the same protection applies in 2027.</li>
          <li>If it still doesn’t convey in 2027, it converts into a 2027 2nd-round pick that OKC will receive.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>2027:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>This pick only conveys if the 2026 pick to OKC has already been sent.</li>
          <li>If the 2027 pick lands between 1 and 8, Philadelphia keeps it. If it lands 9 through 30, it goes to the Brooklyn Nets.</li>
          <li>If the pick doesn’t convey in 2027, the same protection will be applied in 2028.</li>
          <li>If the pick is still not conveyed by 2028, it will become a 2028 2nd-round pick.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>2028:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The Sixers only get this pick if it lands between 56 and 60. The Pistons must be a top 5 team in the league for this pick to convey.</li>
          <li>If Detroit is not a top-5 team the pick will not convey to Philadelphia and Detroit will retain this pick.</li>
          <li>Example: If Detroit finishes 25th and the pick is #36, it doesn’t convey and expires.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>2029:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The Sixers have the right to swap their 2029 1st-round pick with the Clippers.</li>
          <li>But the Clippers’ pick is protected if it lands in the top 3.</li>
          <li>Example: If Philly has pick #20 and LAC has pick #9, Sixers can swap and take #9. If LAC’s pick is #2, the swap is voided and Clippers keep their pick.</li>

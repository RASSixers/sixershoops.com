                The Philadelphia 76ers came agonizingly close but fell just short in a gut-wrenching 109-108 defeat.

            <h3>Starters</h3>

            <div class="player-grade">
                <div class="player-info">
                    <div class="player-name">Tyrese Maxey</div>
                    <div class="player-stats">26 PTS • 8 REB • 14 AST • 8-16 FG • 4-9 3PT • 6-7 FT</div>

                <div class="grade grade-a">A-</div>
            </div>

            <p>
                Maxey was sensational, dropping 26 points while orchestrating the offense with 14 assists. He controlled the tempo and made winning plays all night.
            </p>

            <p>
                The 50% shooting and 85.7% from the stripe shows his composure. His 5 turnovers were high, but given his usage, understandable. He did everything to will the Sixers to victory.
            </p>

            <div class="player-grade">
                <div class="player-info">
                    <div class="player-name">VJ Edgecombe</div>
                    <div class="player-stats">17 PTS • 5 REB • 5 AST • 7-11 FG • 2-4 3PT • 1-1 FT</div>

                <div class="grade grade-a">A+</div>
            </div>

            <p>
                Outstanding performance from the rookie with efficient 7-11 shooting, including 2-4 from deep. Added 5 rebounds and 5 assists with just 1 turnover in 40 minutes.
            </p>

            <p>
                His efficiency and all-around contribution were exceptional for a young player in a close game. Mature beyond his years.
            </p>

            <div class="player-grade">
                <div class="player-info">
                    <div class="player-name">Kelly Oubre Jr.</div>
                    <div class="player-stats">17 PTS • 9 REB • 6-12 FG • 3-7 3PT • 2-6 FT</div>

                <div class="grade grade-b">B-</div>
            </div>

            <p>
                Oubre had a nice scoring night with 17 points and pulled down 9 boards. The 42.9% from three was solid, though he could've been more aggressive.
            </p>

            <p>
                The 2-6 from the stripe and 3 turnovers were careless in a one-point game.
            </p>

            <div class="player-grade">
                <div class="player-info">
                    <div class="player-name">Joel Embiid</div>
                    <div class="player-stats">20 PTS • 6 REB • 3 AST • 6-13 FG • 1-2 3PT • 7-7 FT</div>

                <div class="grade grade-b">B+</div>
            </div>

            <p>
                Another dominant performance from the big man with 20 points, 6 rebounds, and 3 assists in 25 minutes. The 6-13 shooting wasn't his most efficient.
            </p>

            <p>
                Got to the line and was perfect (7-7). Would've liked to see him play more in a close game, but the minutes restriction was a key factor.
            </p>

            <div class="player-grade">
                <div class="player-info">
                    <div class="player-name">Jabari Walker</div>
                    <div class="player-stats">2 PTS • 1 REB • 1-2 FG • 0-0 3PT</div>

                <div class="grade grade-c">C-</div>
            </div>

            <p>
                Tough night for Walker with just 2 points and 1 rebound in 11 minutes. He was practically invisible out there, finishing -3 in plus/minus.
            </p>

            <p>
                In a game decided by one point, the Sixers needed more production from this spot.
            </p>

            <h3>Bench</h3>

            <div class="player-grade">
                <div class="player-info">
                    <div class="player-name">Quentin Grimes</div>
                    <div class="player-stats">16 PTS • 2 REB • 3 AST • 6-13 FG • 2-7 3PT • 2-4 FT</div>

                <div class="grade grade-b">B-</div>
            </div>

            <p>
                Grimes gave 33 solid minutes with 16 points, but the efficiency wasn't there. The 2-4 from the line and 3 turnovers hurt in a one-point loss.
            </p>

            <p>
                His -15 plus/minus was the worst on the team, and he hesitated with the game on the line when the Sixers needed a bucket most.
            </p>

            <div class="player-grade">
                <div class="player-info">
                    <div class="player-name">Andre Drummond</div>
                    <div class="player-stats">6 PTS • 2 REB • 1-3 FG • 3-4 FT</div>
                </div>
                <div class="grade grade-b">B+</div>
            </div>

            <p>
                Drummond was solid on the boards and made the most of his touches with 6 points. The 3-4 from the line was solid.
            </p>

            <p>
                His +7 plus/minus in 12 minutes shows he provided a spark. Would've liked to see him get more run.
            </p>

            <div class="player-grade">
                <div class="player-info">
                    <div class="player-name">Trendon Watford</div>

                <div class="grade grade-d">D</div>
            </div>

            <p>
                Rough outing. Watford was scoreless with just 1 assist and 1 turnover in 11 minutes. His -7 plus/minus was brutal.
            </p>

            <p>
                In a one-point game, the Sixers desperately needed something from this spot.
            </p>

            <div class="player-grade">
                <div class="player-info">
                    <div class="player-name">Justin Edwards</div>

                <div class="grade grade-c">C-</div>
            </div>

            <p>
                Limited impact in 12 minutes with just 2 points on 1-5 shooting. Grabbed 4 rebounds and added an assist, but the 0-3 from deep hurt.
            </p>

            <p>
                His -3 plus/minus shows he wasn't moving the needle. Needed better shot selection.
            </p>

            <div class="player-grade">
                <div class="player-info">

                <div class="grade grade-c">C-</div>
            </div>

            <p>
                Minimal contribution with 2 points and 3 rebounds in 11 minutes. The 2 blocks show he was active defensively.
            </p>

            <p>
                But the -10 plus/minus is concerning. Sixers were significantly worse with him on the floor.
